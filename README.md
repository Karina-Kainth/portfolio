## 🧠 Brain-Computer Interface Projects

### [Focus-Level Monitor](https://medium.com/@karinakainth30/building-a-focus-level-monitor-to-tackle-short-attention-spans-b9ff1b340bff)
A system that measures real-time attention using EEG data and displays it on a live dashboard.  
- **Goal:** Address short attention spans through quantifiable focus tracking.  
- **Tools:** Python, EEG Muse2 Headband, BlueMuse
- **Highlights:**  
  - Processed EEG data streams to estimate focus intensity.  
  - Designed visualization to help users understand their attention levels over time.  

### [Mind-Controlled Speaker](https://medium.com/@karinakainth30/i-paused-played-a-song-on-a-speaker-by-thinking-about-it-7f32bea7ad4f)
An IoT project where a user can **play or pause music using thought patterns**.  
- **Goal:** Explore how neural data can control IoT devices.  
- **Tools:** Python, EEG Muse2 Headband, BlueMuse, Bluetooth, Speaker 
- **Highlights:**  
  - Created a real-time communication link between EEG readings and audio playback.  
  - Implemented a simple control algorithm to detect user intent.

## 🏫 School Design Project

### APS112 — Noise-Regulated Classroom
- **Partner:** Lansdowne Public School  
- **Objective:** Reduce classroom noise and engage students in self-regulation.  
- **Design:** Interactive “Choose Your Own Adventure” (CYOA) system:
  - **Path 1:** Research on noise effects and health impacts.  
  - **Path 2:** Educational ASL learning initiative.  
- **Prototype:** Visual poster boards with layered foam panels that absorb sound energy and serve as progress trackers for classroom noise levels.  
- **Outcome:** Functional, low-cost classroom intervention combining learning and environmental control.

## 🎮 Coding Projects

### No-Internet Game (Pygame Recreation)
A full recreation of the Google Chrome “No Internet” dinosaur game using Pygame.  
- **Tools:** Python, Pygame  
- **Features:** Dynamic obstacle spawning, score tracking, collision detection.  
- **Goal:** Strengthen object-oriented programming and game loop design skills.

### 🎯 Whack-a-Mole (FPGA-Based Game)
A hardware-based implementation of the classic **Whack-a-Mole** game built using an FPGA, PS/2 keyboard input, and VGA display output.

# 🎯 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my **Digital Systems** course and focused on designing a fully functional interactive game at the hardware level.

The game renders randomly appearing moles on a VGA display. Users select difficulty levels and "whack" moles using keyboard inputs. The objective is to reach a score of **10** to win.

# ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Hardware:** FPGA Development Board  
- **HDL:** Verilog  
- **Software Tools:**  
  - Quartus Prime  
  - ModelSim  
- **Peripherals:**  
  - PS/2 Keyboard  
  - VGA Display  
  - 7-Segment Displays  

# 🧩 System Design & Components
The design integrates multiple digital systems concepts, including:

- **Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR)** for random mole generation  
- **Finite State Machines (FSMs)** for game state control  
- **Flip-Flops** for state storage  
- **Half-Second Timers** for mole timing and transitions  
- **7-Segment Displays** for score output  
- **VGA Controller** for real-time graphics rendering  
- **Keyboard Decoder** for user input and level selection  

# 🎮 Gameplay Mechanics
- Users select difficulty levels using the PS/2 keyboard.
- Moles appear randomly on the VGA screen.
- Specific keyboard keys correspond to mole positions.
- Correct hits increase the score.
- The game ends when the user reaches a score of **10**.

# 🧠 Key Learning Outcomes
- Hardware-software co-design using Verilog  
- Real-time VGA signal generation  
- Modular digital system design  
- Debugging and simulation using ModelSim  
- Timing control and synchronization in hardware
