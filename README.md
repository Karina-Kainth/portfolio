## 🧠 Brain-Computer Interface Projects

### [Focus-Level Monitor](https://medium.com/@karinakainth30/building-a-focus-level-monitor-to-tackle-short-attention-spans-b9ff1b340bff)
A system that measures real-time attention using EEG data and displays it on a live dashboard.  
- **Goal:** Address short attention spans through quantifiable focus tracking.  
- **Tools:** Python, EEG Muse2 Headband, BlueMuse
- **Highlights:**  
  - Processed EEG data streams to estimate focus intensity.  
  - Designed visualization to help users understand their attention levels over time.  

### [Mind-Controlled Speaker](https://medium.com/@karinakainth30/i-paused-played-a-song-on-a-speaker-by-thinking-about-it-7f32bea7ad4f)
An IoT project where a user can **play or pause music using thought patterns**.  
- **Goal:** Explore how neural data can control IoT devices.  
- **Tools:** Python, EEG Muse2 Headband, BlueMuse, Bluetooth, Speaker 
- **Highlights:**  
  - Created a real-time communication link between EEG readings and audio playback.  
  - Implemented a simple control algorithm to detect user intent.

## 🚀 Hackathon Project

### Moonshot Hackathon — *Preventing Epileptic Episodes Using Acoustic Holograms*
- **Challenge:** Propose the “next big thing” for healthcare innovation.  
- **Concept:** Use **acoustic holography** to prevent epileptic seizures by modulating neural activity non-invasively.  
- **My Role:** Technical lead and concept modeler — developed system flow and feasibility analysis.  
- **Outcome:** Designed early-stage framework for a preventive neural feedback device.

## 🏫 School Design Project

### APS112 — Noise-Regulated Classroom
- **Partner:** Lansdowne Public School  
- **Objective:** Reduce classroom noise and engage students in self-regulation.  
- **Design:** Interactive “Choose Your Own Adventure” (CYOA) system:
  - **Path 1:** Research on noise effects and health impacts.  
  - **Path 2:** Educational ASL learning initiative.  
- **Prototype:** Visual poster boards with layered foam panels that absorb sound energy and serve as progress trackers for classroom noise levels.  
- **Outcome:** Functional, low-cost classroom intervention combining learning and environmental control.

## 🎮 Coding Project

### No-Internet Game (Pygame Recreation)
A full recreation of the Google Chrome “No Internet” dinosaur game using Pygame.  
- **Tools:** Python, Pygame  
- **Features:** Dynamic obstacle spawning, score tracking, collision detection.  
- **Goal:** Strengthen object-oriented programming and game loop design skills.
